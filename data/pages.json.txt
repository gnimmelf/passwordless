{"about":{"body":"A/BARENESS is a slow fashion brand based in Nepal & Norway. We focus on making wearable, timeless and seasonless clothes & accessories in an ethical & ecofriendly way.\n\nWe, the founders of A/BARENESS, have been friends for more then 20 years. We have worked within different fields of the fashion industry and traveled the world together and ended up working in Nepal, taking part of an exchange program with the Norwegian Peace Corps.\n\nWhile completing our tasks and preparing to go back to Norway we realized that our mission in Nepal was far from completed and A/BARENESS came to life.\n\nWe get inspired by the cultural differences between Norway and Nepal, but also within Nepal itself – it is a charming mix of cultures; Nepalis, Hindus Tibetans and Japanese are among the influences that are all stirred together amidst this Himalayan landscape.\n\nOur designs are a fusion of elements from our adventures, experiences and everyday life in Nepal and Norway and the typical clean Scandinavian style.\n\nOur design mantra is the famous quote by fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent:\n\n \n\n> \"FASHION FADES, STYLE IS ETERNAL\"\n \n\nWe try to make earth-friendly decisions whenever we can and we believe that all small things really do count.\n\nAfter all, many small drops make a mighty ocean.\n\nA/BARENESS is a transparent brand and aim to show and tell the consumer the story about the process behind our products.\n\nVisit our blog abareness.blogspot.no to learn more about our production in Nepal, read interviews with various people we work with here or just to get some inspiration.\n\nHave a feel-good & fashionable day!\n\n♥ Karoline & Anne-Marthe \n","title":"About"},"terms":{"body":"## Terms of service\n### Shipping, Terms & Conditions\n\nTerms:\n\nWhen you place the order it will usually take between 2-5 business days to before you receive the package.
